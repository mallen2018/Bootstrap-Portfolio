             I grew up in South America and moved to the US when I was 15. It was a huge change and little bit of a culture shock! I began university at the age of 17 and graduated with a degree in Finance. I spent many years working on the logistics and operations side of multiple business units and decided to go back to the finance side a few years ago. Now I have reached a point where I want to continue expanding my knowledge and have moved to the technical side of business. Tech is the backbone and the growth of all modern business units and the most interesting part of all industries!
